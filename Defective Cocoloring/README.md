Defective Cocoloring
======

Python 3 code and Julia code for dealing with finite, simple graphs. Allows for
computation of defective cocoloring numbers and associated extremal
graphs.

Usage
-----

DefectiveRamsey consists of three executable program (`cocoloringPerfect_1_2.py`, `cocoloringPerfect_2_2.py`, `cocoloringPerfect_1_3.jl`)

To compute the C^PG_1(2), run `cocoloringPerfect_1_2.py`.
To compute the C^PG_2(2), run `cocoloringPerfect_2_2.py`.
To compute the C^PG_1(3), run `cocoloringPerfect_1_3.jl`.
